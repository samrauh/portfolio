# Data Science Portfolio - Samuel Rauh

This portfolio consists of the projects related to Data Science and quantitative analysis I have done for my university degree as well as hobby and learning purposes.

## About Me

In summer 2023 I finished my bachelors degree in Sociology at the University of Zurich. I realized quickly that my main interests lay in quantitative research. Lukily for me, the Sociological Institute in Zurich has its focus on qualitative research and correspondingly focuses its teaching.
With my minor in People Oriented Computing I was able to extend my coding skills and I got a better view at the world of computer science. I really enjoyed it and by the third semester it was clear for me that I want to porsue a career further in the direction of data science.
