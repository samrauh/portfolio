During my civil service at the (ETH Chair of Education Systems) [https://ces.ethz.ch/] I got the chance to work on the (Youth Labour Market Index) [https://ces.ethz.ch/research/benchmark-instruments/YLMI.html].

> "The CES Youth Labour Market Index (CES YLMI) is a multidimensional composite index that enables comparison of young people’s labour market situation across countries and over time. The index consists of twelve indicators grouped into four dimensions. In contrast a single-​indicator approach using something like the unemployment rate, the CES YLMI accounts for multiple aspects of employment."
