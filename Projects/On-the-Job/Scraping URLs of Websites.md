# Automated Outlook Appointment Creator

> Keywords: VBA, Excel, VBA

Using VBA I added a funciton to an existing Excel file which lets the user automaticall create appointments in Outlook.

The Excel file can contain containes titles and dates. Based on the titles the script createds appointments and automatically adds the right people. If the appontment is already saved in the calendar it is skipped.
