# Mediakeys - Automation of Photo REportings

>Keyswords: Python, Tkinter, GUI, Workflow Automation

Mediakeys is a media-agency that specializes in the realization of Out-of-Home advertising campaigns.
To some of it provides a reporting in the form of a Powerpoint presentation with pictures of the billboards.
The presentation is usually sorted according to the type of advertising and the region.

Using Python and the GUI-tool Tkinter I created an application which supports the employees in the process of creating these reportings and makes it much more time efficient.
It also helps with the unification of the reportings sice they are created automatically.

Depending on the customer the user can select a template and input a company title, a name and a date. In the next step the user can create categories and subcategories in which the pictures should be placed.
The categories can be adjusted accordingly. The pictures can then be added by copy-pasting them into the application and they are placed according to the selected categories. This process is repeated until all pictures are copied into the application. The user now only needs to click on the generate button and as a product gets the final Powerpoint presentation with all the pictures in order.
