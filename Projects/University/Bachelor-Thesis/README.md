This is my bachelor thesis for my major in sociology I wrote under Prof. Dr. Jörg Rössel who was at that time the head of Departmant at University of Zurich for Sociology.

#### Abstract:

The relationship between diversity and company performance is already a much-studied topic. However, the social context of companies is often ignored. This study examines the relationship between diversity on the boards of directors of listed companies and their performance. The focus is on sex and nationality as diversity characteristics. It also examines how the relationship changes depending on how accepted diversity is in the companies' country of origin. The analysis finds evidence of a negative correlation between diversity (gender and nationality) and company performance. A moderating effect of the social context is found for gender diversity, which means that diversity has a more positive effect on performance when it is more accepted in society.

Unfortunately I'm not able to give access to all the data, since its access is restricted by the publisher Bureau van Dijk.
