This seminar paper was a group project. I mainly contributed to the data gathering and processing and the data analysis. I wrote the Analysis and the Methods part in the paper.

### Abstract:

Price discrimination is a pricing strategy that creates variation in the prices charged to
customers. This has normative implications, as soon as the purchase of a product or
service is not voluntary, but required by law, as is often the case in the car insurance
market. Our paper was aimed to explore price discrimination in the Swiss car insurance
market by using a novel data set of unstructured data. Using automated data extraction
of web data from the insurance comparison website ”comparis.ch” we were able to
gather a data-set according to our pre-selected strata of characteristics. The novel
data set features 145 requests with 2007 price offerings across 4 demographic traits
holding everything else constant. The data-set allowed an exploratory study into
the discriminatory character of insurance pricing across various demographic traits
including preliminary analyses with a simple regression model. We found evidence
that price discrimination is present in the specification of our data. We review the
presented evidence with regards to its explanatory power and conclude by discussing
the consequences of price discrimination and policy suggestions.
